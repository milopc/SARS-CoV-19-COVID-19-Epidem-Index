# SARS-CoV-19-COVID-19-Epidem-Index
This repository stores the files where we developed an epidemiology project for SARS-CoV-19, aka. Covid-19, using the disretization of the heat disperssion equation in order to calculate and determine epidemiological indexes for each state based on an initial infection scenario with 4 states where it was estimated the epidemic could begin. Then, we determine the percentage of population susceptible of infection, with which we then determine the amount of infected population per state.
